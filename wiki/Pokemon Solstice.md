# Update

### As of **4/11/5** all information regarding Pokémon Solstice can be found on the [Official Solstice Wiki](https://pokemon-solstice.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Solstice_Wiki)     



#### **Why Fandom Was Chosen**

While Fandom was not the initial choice for hosting the Pokémon Solstice wiki, alternative options—such as using [git-wiki](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme)—presented several challenges. Git-based wiki systems, while powerful, are less suited for visually rich content and customization. Markdown, the primary formatting language used by git-wiki, isn't designed for extensive graphic integration or advanced layout control, making it difficult to present the content in a clean and accessible way.

Although it’s possible to enhance git-wiki through advanced customization or even build a completely custom wiki using GitHub Pages or self-hosting, these approaches require significantly more time and effort. In contrast, Fandom offers an easy-to-use interface with many built-in features that are well-suited for a fan game wiki, such as templates, category systems, and multimedia support.

For now, Fandom will serve as the official home for the Pokémon Solstice wiki. Future projects may explore other platforms depending on their specific needs.
