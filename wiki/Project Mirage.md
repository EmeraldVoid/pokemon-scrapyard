# Project Status  
![On Hold](https://img.shields.io/badge/On_Hold-ff0000) - This project is not currently in development.  

## Additional Info from Emerald  
Project Mirage was ultimately put on hold due to a lack of creative "spark" that made it exciting to develop. Initially, the idea of creating a world and experimenting with ChatGPT to generate a unique Pokémon region was intriguing. However, once the planning phase was complete, the concept didn't resonate as strongly as anticipated. Rather than continue development, the decision was made to flesh out the lore and upload all original design documentation to GitHub for archival purposes.  

# Background  
**Project Mirage** was an experiment conducted by **Emerald_Void** to explore how ChatGPT would handle designing a Pokémon game from the ground up. With minimal input—such as the number of towns, Gym Leaders, and other structural elements—ChatGPT generated the foundation for what became the [**Solvaira Region**](https://emeraldvoid.github.io/pokemon-scrapyard/Solvaira).  

# Design  
The original plan for **Project Mirage** was to develop the game using the **Pokémon Essentials Kit**, a popular fan-made framework for creating Pokémon-style games. The project aimed to experiment with procedural world-building using AI-generated concepts while maintaining the classic Pokémon gameplay structure.  


# Art  
Due to budget constraints, some of the artwork for this project was generated using AI, as hiring a dedicated design team was not financially feasible. The developers acknowledge that AI-generated art (and writing) is a topic of debate within the community and respect individual preferences regarding its use. Despite this, the goal was always to bring the envisioned world to life in the most accessible way possible.
