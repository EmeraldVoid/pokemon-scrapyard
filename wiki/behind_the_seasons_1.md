## What is this?

This is a development log and journal where I document my thoughts, progress, and random musings about *[Pokémon Solstice](https://emeraldvoid.github.io/pokemon-scrapyard/Pokemon%20Solstice)*. It’s a space for me to reflect on the game’s creation and share updates as I go.

## Development Notes

Progress on *Pokémon Solstice* is moving along slowly, and there are several reasons for that:

1. **Learning Game Design**: I’m still relatively new to game design, so I’m learning as I go. As a result, my workflow is a work in progress, and I often find myself jumping between tasks and projects.

2. **Mastering the Tools**: I’m learning both PSDK and Essentials on the fly, which means I frequently pause to watch tutorials and learn new techniques.

3. **Solo Development**: I’m developing the game by myself, handling everything from design to coding to graphics. As a one-person team, it can sometimes feel overwhelming.

4. **Real Life**: I’m also in the process of transitioning to a new job while balancing a 40-hour work week, so development on *Pokémon Solstice* is understandably slow.

## Things Accomplished

- **Fakemon Additions**: I’ve started adding new fakemon to the game.
  - Added Water-type starter and Grass-type starter with full evolution lines.
  - Custom graphics for the Grass starter evolution line by [Feyrah](https://www.deviantart.com/feyrah/art/Fakemon-Grass-Starter-394530332).
  - Custom graphics for the Water starter evolution line by [Magiscarf](https://www.deviantart.com/magiscarf).

## To-Do List

- [ ] Complete database editing (fakemon, Pokémon, items, abilities, etc.)
- [ ] Storyboarding and writing
- [ ] More tasks to be discovered as development progresses
