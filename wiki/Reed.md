## Biography  

Reed grew up on the **stormy coasts of Stormport City**, a bustling harbor town known for its treacherous tides and skilled seafarers. As a child, he spent his days helping local fishermen and studying how Water-type Pokémon adapted to the harsh ocean environment. His first Pokémon, a feisty **Carvanha**, was rescued from a storm, and from that moment, Reed was determined to become a Trainer who could command the raw power of the sea.  

After years of training under experienced sailors and Gym Leaders from other regions, Reed returned to **Stormport City** and earned the title of Gym Leader. His battle strategy revolves around **flowing unpredictability**, using a mix of offense, defense, and status-inflicting moves to simulate the ocean's ever-changing temperament. Reed believes that a strong Trainer must learn to adapt, much like how a sailor must respect the sea's power.  

Beyond Gym battles, Reed serves as a protector of Stormport's waters, working alongside marine researchers to ensure Pokémon habitats remain safe from overfishing and pollution. He is also known to mentor younger Trainers, emphasizing patience, strategy, and respect for nature.
