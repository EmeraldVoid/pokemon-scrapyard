# Welcome to Emerald’s Pokémon Scrapyard Wiki!

This wiki is a collection of unfinished Pokémon projects, concepts, and experiments created using Pokémon Essentials and PSDK. It serves as a hub for all my Pokémon-related work—whether finished, unfinished, or just wild ideas. Inside, you'll find design documents, proof-of-concept builds, brainstorming notes, and more.
