## Biography  

Born and raised in **Hearthpine City**, a town surrounded by ancient forests, Ivy developed a deep admiration for nature and its balance. As a child, she would spend hours studying the way Pokémon coexisted with the environment, fascinated by how Grass-types flourished through resilience and adaptability. This love for nature eventually led her to become a **Grass-type Pokémon expert**.  

Ivy took over as Gym Leader after her mentor, an elderly botanist and Trainer, retired. She transformed the Hearthpine City Gym into a **living garden battlefield**, where vines, trees, and moss-covered stones provide unique terrain advantages. Her battle philosophy revolves around **sustainability and endurance**, using defensive tactics, status moves, and healing strategies to wear down challengers.  

Outside of battles, Ivy works on conservation efforts, protecting local Pokémon habitats from expansion and deforestation. She also crafts herbal remedies from local plants and shares them with travelers passing through Hearthpine City.
