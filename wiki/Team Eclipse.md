# Team Eclipse  

Team Eclipse is a mysterious and dangerous **villainous organization** operating in the **Solvaria** region. They believe in harnessing the power of **light and darkness** to reshape the world according to their vision, seeking to control the balance between nature and the cosmos itself. Unlike other villainous teams that simply pursue wealth or domination, Team Eclipse views themselves as **harbingers of a new era**, claiming that the natural cycle of day and night, life and destruction, must be **"corrected"** in order to create a perfect world. To achieve this, they seek to awaken an ancient **Legendary Pokémon** said to embody the forces of both light and shadow, believing it will grant them the power to rebuild Solvaria in their own image.  

Their **home base** is hidden deep within **Eclipsed Cavern**, a secret stronghold located beneath **Obsidian Ridge**, a treacherous mountain range where light barely reaches. The cavern is said to be filled with strange **runes and ancient technology**, remnants of a long-forgotten civilization that once worshipped the very Pokémon Team Eclipse seeks to control. From this base, their leader and top officers coordinate attacks on research facilities, Pokémon Labs, and even the **Pokémon League**, all in pursuit of their ultimate goal.  

## Leader: **Commander Nyx**  

Commander **Nyx** is a calculating and enigmatic leader who wields **both strategy and charisma** to keep her organization in check. She claims that Team Eclipse is not a mere criminal group but a **revolutionary force** meant to bring balance to the world. Dressed in flowing black and silver robes adorned with eclipse emblems, Nyx presents herself as a prophet of the new world she intends to create. She is **highly intelligent, ruthless in battle, and unwavering in her ideals**—defeat is never an option for her.
