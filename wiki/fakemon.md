# Fakémon

**Fake Pokémon**, or **Fakemon** for short (alternatively **Fakémon**), is a fan term for unofficial Pokémon created by fans. A similar term among Japanese fans is オリポケ (Oripoké), derived from オリジナルポケモン (Original Pokémon).

Fakémon often expand upon existing Pokémon lore, adding new species, evolutions, abilities, and typings that do not exist in the official games.
