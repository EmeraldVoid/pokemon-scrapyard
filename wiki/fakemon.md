# Fakémon

**Fake Pokémon**, or **Fakemon** for short (alternatively **Fakémon**), is a fan term for unofficial Pokémon created by fans. A similar term among Japanese fans is オリポケ (Oripoké), derived from オリジナルポケモン (Original Pokémon).

Fakémon often expand upon existing Pokémon lore, adding new species, evolutions, abilities, and typings that do not exist in the official games.

# **List of Fakémon**  

A [complete list of Fakémon](https://emeraldvoid.github.io/pokemon-scrapyard/list_of_fakemon) can be found here.  

Fakémon in this list vary in detail—some have official artwork, full stat blocks, and evolution lines, while others are still in the brainstorming phase. Some were created for fun, while others have a deeper role in the world of *Pokémon Solstice*.

# Disclaimer and Additional Information
Some of the Fakémon artwork featured on this wiki was created using AI. This was primarily due to two reasons: first, Emerald_Void was unable to commission artists for contributions, and second, they do not have the artistic skills to create the designs themselves.

Here at The Scrapyard, we recognize that AI-generated art is a sensitive topic for some. If you prefer traditional artwork and are not a fan of AI-generated images, that's completely understandable. We hope there's still plenty of information here to keep you engaged. However, if you're open to AI art or simply curious to see the unique Fakémon concepts that have been created, we invite you to explore further!
