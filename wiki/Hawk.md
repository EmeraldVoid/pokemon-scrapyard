## Biography
Hawk is a former aerial performer who once participated in sky races with his Pokémon. His love for speed and flight led him to train Flying-type Pokémon, valuing precision and agility over brute force. While he often comes across as carefree, in battle, he is a relentless strategist who refuses to let opponents take control.

Hawk believes that the sky belongs to those who dare to fly high and fast. Challengers who face him must be prepared to deal with relentless aerial assaults, as he gives them no time to breathe. Those who can keep up with his breakneck pace earn his respect.
