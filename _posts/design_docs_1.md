Saurky, the **Aqua Chick Pokémon**, is the adorable yet determined Water-type starter of its region. With soft, sleek feathers that shimmer like the ocean’s surface, this Pokémon is as comfortable in the air as it is in the water. Its webbed feet help it paddle quickly through rivers and lakes, while its developing wings allow it to make short, fluttering leaps. Though small in size, Saurky is full of energy and curiosity, often playfully splashing its Trainer or darting around in excitement. Many beginning Trainers are drawn to its friendly and loyal nature, making it a popular choice for a first partner Pokémon.  

As Saurky grows and evolves into **Crestaka** at level 18, it takes on a more majestic and confident form. This middle evolution sports a prominent feathered crest, a sign of its increasing strength and aerial prowess. Crestaka is known for its agility, capable of gliding just above the water’s surface before diving in to catch prey. While still primarily a Water-type, its wings become more defined, hinting at the **Water/Flying** typing it will gain upon evolving into **Avipex** at level 30. Trainers who bond with Crestaka often describe it as both playful and fiercely protective, as it becomes more aware of its surroundings and its Trainer’s needs.  

Upon reaching its final form, **Avipex**, this Pokémon transforms into a formidable, regal avian with an impressive wingspan and an authoritative presence. Now a fully-fledged Water/Flying type, Avipex soars through stormy skies with ease, using the power of the wind and waves to overwhelm opponents. Its feathers have adapted to be both aerodynamic and water-resistant, allowing it to transition seamlessly between air and sea. Legends say that flocks of Avipex gather before heavy storms, guiding lost ships to safety with their cries. In battle, it is known for its speed and devastating aerial attacks, often striking from above before its foes can react.  

One of the most intriguing aspects of Saurky and its evolutions is their **close bond with water currents and wind patterns**. Trainers who raise them often find that these Pokémon are highly sensitive to changes in the weather, reacting to upcoming storms or shifts in humidity before humans notice. Their unique combination of **mobility, power, and intelligence** makes them excellent partners for adventurous Trainers who love exploring both land and sea. Competitive battlers also value Avipex for its versatility, boasting moves like **Hurricane, Scald, and Brave Bird**, making it a formidable opponent against a variety of foes.  

Despite its strong and proud nature, Avipex never loses its connection to its playful beginnings as a Saurky. Trainers who raise this Pokémon from its first stage often note that even at its most powerful, Avipex will still enjoy diving playfully into water or nudging its Trainer for attention. This evolutionary line is a prime example of Pokémon that start off as endearing companions but grow into noble and powerful battlers, forming an unbreakable bond with those who journey alongside them. Whether chosen for battle, exploration, or companionship, **Saurky and its evolutions make for an unforgettable Pokémon experience**.

I've started working on [Pokémon Solstice](https://emeraldvoid.github.io/pokemon-scrapyard/Pokemon%20Solstice), and this is the concept I'm considering for the Water starter. There aren't any concrete design decisions yet—right now, I'm just exploring ideas while getting familiar with the Essentials Kit and PSDK.
